How to deploy & use your own Faucet Contract ?

1. First you need to do is edit "deploy.js" using "nano deploy.js" and set your own DEV_ADDRESS & DEV_PRIVATE_KEY

2. Then you should deploy your contract, (I advice use remix for lower fees).
If you want to use remix, copy all the content on faucet.sol, paste it on a new file on remix, compilate and deploy on Base Chain
If you want to use the code simply run node deploy.js after you fill your wallet details (make sure to have enough funds for fees).

3. After contract is deployed you should edit faucetABI.json using "nano faucetABI.json",
scroll down and you should replace "YOUR_CONTRACT_HERE" with your contract deployed.

4. After you deploy & set your deployed contract you can run node transfers.js, first you should transfer funds to the contract.

5. After contract is filled you should use "Manage Whitelist" for whitelisting each one of the wallets that gonna claim the faucet.

6. After all wallets are whitelisted you can use "Claim Funds From Contract".
Insert the amount that ALL wallets gonna claim like (I advice 0.0014 o 0.0015) So they can have fees for minting,
after you make that the code gonna start claiming fees on each wallet.

NOTE:

1. No problem if the wallets are empty, fees are paid from deployed address not from claiming account
2. After claiming funds you can remove whitelist if you wish and withdraw non-used funds from contract
