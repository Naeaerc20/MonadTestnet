Set "https://localhost/callback" in "Callback URI / Redirect URL" and "https://example.com" on "Website URL".
This setting will allow the API to interact with your X account

4. Generate your API_KEY, API_SECRET_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN & ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET Example: "https://prnt.sc/dWItHNxZGSRn"
Copy them and save them in "credentials.json". The main code of Faucet.Trade has option to add it directly without any manual effort.
